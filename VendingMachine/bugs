In the VendingMachineClass, I found a bug when the user gives a negative value to the balance field. 
This was overlooked by the fact that the balance field is initialized to a final value of zero
and it is not validated by the constructor.
That's why the bug was passing in the AssertEquals() assertion statements and also with the exception clause. 
In the VendingMachineItem constructor I changed the price for this.price = price because
when I was running AllTests, I saw an error in the way the price field was being instantiated.
In summary, I fixed the constructor on both classes to not instantiate negative values.
